# Volt_Touchscreen_Files

These files are simply here as a basic repo for quick access later.

The .apk file is the latest app as of today, 23 April 2020.

The .idc file is needed for the AR1100 chip for Android to recognize the touchscreen as a digitizer.
It needs placed in the /system/usr/idc folder.
